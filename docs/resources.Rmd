# Getting started

**Objectives**

* Ensuring access to your Google account in `RStudio Server`
* Copy the [social media data gathering template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQy8kR81GHmMDPivpyd8XzAGU7A6oUCUArq1bltm5EQ/edit?usp=sharing) into your own Google account
* Similarly, you can inspect the [example dataset that I created](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K-tgni6JJ33x1mG-rxNFopnC8sBuRzVLd5loBO0e1jk/edit?usp=sharing).
    + The [Project3 page](https://ea30-fa20.github.io/ConsSocMedia/Project3.html) includes a fully worked example using this dataset, starting with reading the data into `RStudio Server`, cleaning the text data, performing a linear regression, and includes (completely optional extensions on) outlier removal, visualizing model predictions with plots (instead of tables), and including interaction effects.
* You will create your own social media dataset focused on an environmental issue. Please pay special attention to any curation/selection/filtering that you do to come up with focused search terms to generate a set of posts that discuss clearly related topics.
    + [VidGrid explainer on some elements to consider when constructing your social media dataset](https://app.vidgrid.com/content/eueB3RlvI1k4)

**Date range: 11/1 - 11/10**

* [Week 1 slides focused on authenticating access to Google accounts in `RStudio Server`](https://rpubs.com/chchang47/ea30proj3s1)
    + [Video explainer link](https://app.vidgrid.com/content/eueB3RlvI1k4)
* [Code snippet to copy over into your console](https://ea30-fa20.github.io/ConsSocMedia/Project3.html) - copy over the first code chunk into your `RStudio Server` console
    + First, I suggest starting a new session in `RStudio Server`. This is just nice to ensure that your previous workspace/variables are cordoned off from this new project.
    + Click the `r fontawesome::fa("home")` icon on the top-right to navigate to your user space
    + You should then see a list of `Sessions`, including `~/Climate_Change_Narratives`
    + Click the `+ New Session` button
    + Subsequently you can label this session with a name by selecting the `Sessions (n)` button in the top-right and selecting `Label Current Session..` in the drop-down menu.
    
## Deliverable

* [Assignment 1](https://EA30-FA20.github.io/ConsSocMedia/assignments.html): Describing your dataset and hypotheses (Section **1** in document)
    + Due: 11/13 at midnight

# Analyzing your social media data

* The [code folder](https://github.com/EA30-FA20/ConsSocMedia/tree/main/code) contains snippets of code and a template RMarkdown file that may be helpful in making progress in this project.
* Note that the code revisits many elements of the [Project 3 page](https://ea30-fa20.github.io/ConsSocMedia/Project3.html)
